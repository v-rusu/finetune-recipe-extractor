Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).\\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry angel food cake mix and the crushed pineapple with its juice.\\n3. Stir gently until fully blended and no dry pockets remain. Do not overmix.\\n4. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube or angel food cake pan.\\n5.

Converting these to ISO 8601 durations: prepTime is PT10M, cookTime PT40M, totalTime PT2H50M. The recipeYield is \"12 servings\" since it says Servings: 12 and Yield: 1 cake, but the yield field should probably be \"12 servings\" or \"1 (10-inch) cake\". The example given in the user\\'s template uses \"4 servings\", so maybe \"12 servings\" is better here. Alternatively, combine both: \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\". But the original text says \"Servings: 12\" so I\\'ll go with \"12 servings\".\\n\\nIngredients are the cake mix and crushed pineapple. The quantities are 16-ounce package and 20-ounce can, so the recipeIngredient array should have those exact strings as listed.\\n\\nFor instructions, each step from 1 to 7 needs to be a HowToStep. The optional tip about the serrated knife isn\\'t part of the main steps, so I\\'ll skip that. The storage note is also not an instruction step.\\n\\nCategory and cuisine: The example uses \"Main Course\" and \"Italian\", but this is a dessert. So recipeCategory should be \"Dessert\". The cuisine isn\\'t specified, so maybe omit it or leave as empty. The user\\'s example included it, but if the text mentions nothing, better to exclude. However, sometimes pineapple is associated with tropical or Hawaiian, but the recipe doesn\\'t specify. So perhaps omit recipeCuisine.\\n\\nKeywords: The text mentions \"light, fluffy dessert\", \"naturally fruity\", \"pineapple\", \"cake\". The user\\'s example uses \"pasta, dinner\", so here maybe \"pineapple, cake, dessert, easy\".\\n\\nPutting it all together, check for any missing fields. The user\\'s template includes recipeCategory, recipeCuisine, keywords. If the text doesn\\'t specify cuisine, maybe leave it out. The example had it, but if not present, better to avoid incorrect info.\\n\\nSo the final JSON should have name, description, ingredients, instructions, times, yield, category as Dessert, keywords. Cuisine can be omitted if not present. The user\\'s example included it, but in the given text, there\\'s no mention, so better to skip.\\n\\nDouble-check the times: prepTime PT10M, cookTime PT40M, totalTime PT2H50M. The additional time is 2 hours, which is cooling time, but total time is sum of prep + cook + additional. So totalTime is correct as PT2H50M.\\n\\nRecipe yield: \"12 servings\" and \"1 (10-inch) cake\". The user\\'s example used \"4 servings\", but here the text says \"Servings: 12\" and \"Yield: 1 (10-inch) cake\". Maybe combine both: \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\" but the schema allows a text string. So \"12 servings\" is acceptable, but including the yield as well. Wait, the original text has \"Servings: 12\" and \"Yield: 1 (10-inch) cake\". The recipeYield field can take that, so \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\" or just \"12 servings\". The example in the user\\'s prompt used \"4 servings\", so perhaps the user expects the servings. But the text has both, maybe combine. However, the schema.org says recipeYield can be QuantitativeValue or Text. So better to put \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\".\\n\\nBut the user\\'s example has \"4 servings\", so maybe the answer should use \"12 servings\". Alternatively, check the original text: \"Servings: 12\" and \"Yield: 1 (10-inch) cake\". So perhaps the recipeYield is \"1 (10-inch) cake\" and the servings are 12. But the schema uses recipeYield to indicate the quantity produced, which can include both. So maybe \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\".\\n\\nBut the user\\'s example uses \"4 servings\" in recipeYield. So perhaps the answer should use \"12 servings\". Alternatively, the exact text from the \"Yield\" field, which is \"1 (10-inch) cake\". But the user\\'s example uses servings. Hmm. The text says \"Servings: 12\" and \"Yield: 1 (10-inch) cake\". So maybe recipeYield should be \"12 servings\" and the yield is the cake. But the schema allows for text, so perhaps \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\".\\n\\nAlternatively, the user\\'s example uses \"recipeYield\": \"4 servings\", so maybe the answer should take the \"Servings: 12\" as the recipeYield. But the text\\'s \"1 (10-inch) cake is the actual yield. So perhaps the correct approach is to use \"1 (10-inch) cake\" as the recipeYield, and the servings can be part of that. But the schema.org\\'s Recipe doesn\\'t have a separate \"servings\" field; recipeYield is the correct field. So in the text, the Yield is \"1 (10-inch) cake\", and the Servings is 12. So recipeYield could be \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\".\\n\\nI think that\\'s the best approach here. So recipeYield: \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\".\\n\\nKeywords: the text mentions \"light, fluffy dessert\", \"naturally fruity\", \"pineapple\", \"cake\", \"easy\". So keywords could be \"pineapple, cake, dessert, easy\".\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\\n  \"@type\": \"Recipe\",\\n  \"name\": \"2-Ingredient Pineapple Angel Food Cake\",\\n  \"description\": \"This light, fluffy dessert is amazingly simple and naturally fruity, made with just cake mix and crushed pineapple. It’s a great last-minute cake that comes together fast and still feels special, especially served chilled.\",\\n  \"recipeIngredient\": [\\n    \"1 (16-ounce) package angel food cake mix\",\\n    \"1 (20-ounce) can crushed pineapple, in juice (do not drain)\"\\n  ],\\n  \"recipeInstructions\": [\\n    {\\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\\n      \"text\": \"Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\\n      \"text\": \"In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry angel food cake mix and the crushed pineapple with its juice.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\\n      \"text\": \"Stir gently until fully blended and no dry pockets remain. Do not overmix.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\\n      \"text\": \"Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube or angel food cake pan.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\\n      \"text\": \"Bake for 40 minutes, or until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\\n      \"text\": \"Remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert the pan. Let the cake cool completely, about 2 hours.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\\n      \"text\": \"Once cooled, run a knife around the edges and center tube to release the cake. Slice and serve.\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"prepTime\": \"PT10M\",\\n  \"cookTime\": \"PT40M\",\\n  \"totalTime\": \"PT2H50M\",\\n  \"recipeYield\": \"1 (10-inch) cake (12 servings)\",\\n  \"recipeCategory\": \"Dessert\",\\n  \"keywords\": \"pineapple, cake, dessert, easy\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s example includes \"recipeCuisine\" and \"keywords\". The original text doesn\\'t mention a cuisine, so it\\'s better to omit recipeCuisine. The keywords are optional but the user\\'s example includes them, so in the text, the keywords could be derived from the description and title. The description mentions \"naturally fruity\", \"pineapple\", \"cake\", \"dessert\", \"easy\". So keywords could be \"pineapple, cake, dessert, easy\".\\n\\nThe recipeCategory is clearly \"Dessert\".\\n\\nSo the final JSON-LD should include all these fields. Check for any missing parts. The instructions are all there, times are correct. The yield combines both the cake size and servings. The category is Dessert. Keywords are included. recipeCuisine is omitted as not specified. That\\'s correct.\\n</think>\\n\\n{\\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\\n  \"@type\": \"Recipe\",\\n  \"name\": \"2-Ingredient Pineapple Angel Food Cake\",\\n  \"description\": \"This light, fluffy dessert is amazingly simple and naturally fruity, made with just cake mix and crushed pineapple.
